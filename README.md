# Rails with Ollama and Health Query Integration
This Rails leverages Ollama with the `koesn/kesehatan-7b-v0.1` model to provide answers to health-related questions. It is integrated with the COVID-19 referral hospital API in Indonesia, developed by Ariya Hidayat, to offer precise and relevant information about COVID-19 referral hospitals.
